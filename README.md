# pocketSomme

pocketSomme is an Android application I wrote to provide fellow casual wine-lovers with fast look-up capabilities for wine selection. It scrapes data from the public Snooth API, providing information on the wine's rating, region, and foods it pairs well with. The app also maintains a SQLite database of the history and favorited wines of the user, allowing for a passive accumulation of data to inform the user of his or her tastes in varietals, regions, etc.
